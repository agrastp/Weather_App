# Weather_App

## Description
This is a five-day weather website that will generate the weather for any city you input.  Once the city is entered, the API will retrieve the latitude and longitude data, then input it into the API to retrieve the 5-day weather data.  Once a city has been searched, a button will be created for ease in future searches.  Click any city button and current weather data about the city will be retrieved. 

## Installation
